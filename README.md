Basically, there 3 files (and Iâ€™ve included PDFs.)

piaac_code_documentation.md (and pdf) - Python code (as a markdown file) that did most of the work -  data handling and analysis
piaac_simple_converter.py (and pdf) - Python code that converted/transitioned files to be used in R. (I moved over to R to validate the work that was done in Python)
R code final.pdf - Complete R code that essentially replicated what was done in python to validate/verify or double-check.
